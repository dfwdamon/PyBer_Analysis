# PyBer_Analysis

### Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this project is to provide management with a summary of data from a ride-sharing data set.  The analysis of the ride-sharing data will be conducted using Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multiple line-graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.  The goals is to provide insight on how the data differs by city type and how any differences can be used by decision makers. 

### Analysis
The first technical analysis looks at ride-sharing data by city type and includes a summary of the data.

####
This analysis looked at the ride-sharing summary dataframe by city type.  It used `grouppby` function, `count` and `sum` methods on dataframe columns to get the total number of rides, total number of drivers and total fares for each city type. Then the average fair per ride and average fare per driver for each city type was obtained.

### Anaysis of Execution Times
For tracking of the time the code ran, the Timer function was used `startTime = Timer` at the begining of the code just after the user inputs the desired year of analysis to run.  The `endTime = Timer` function terminated the time the code ran and a message box was used to show the resulting run times.  This code was `MsgBox "this code ran in " & (endTime - startTime) & " seconds for the year " & (yearValue)`.
